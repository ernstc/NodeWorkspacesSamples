## Samples for analyzing Node workspaces.

This repository contains several samples that demonstrate how to organize complex applications or libraries coded in `JavaScript` and/or  `TypeScript` in a monorepo.

### Why monorepo? 

Monorepo is a development practice where all the code for an application or microservice is stored in a single repository. This approach has several advantages, such as:

* **Easy visibility:** With all the code in one place, it’s easier to see how different parts of the application or microservice interact with each other. This can help improve collaboration and reduce the risk of bugs.

* **Code sharing:** By having all the code in one place, it’s easier to share code between different parts of the application or microservice. This can help reduce duplication of effort and improve consistency.

* **Improved collaboration.** A monorepo removes barriers and silos between teams, making it easier to design and maintain sets of microservices that work well together.

* **Standardization:** With all the code in one place, it’s easier to standardize code and tooling across different parts of the application or microservice. This can help improve consistency and reduce the risk of errors.

* **Discoverability.** A monorepo offers a single view of the whole code. You can review status for the whole repository, screen all branches, and keep track of modifications much more easily in monorepos than in polyrepos.

* **Smoother release management.** With a monorepo, it’s easier to manage releases across all the packages in the repository. This can help to ensure that all packages are released together and that there are no compatibility issues between them.

* **Easier refactoring.** A monorepo can make it easier to refactor code across multiple packages. This can help to improve the overall quality of the codebase.
